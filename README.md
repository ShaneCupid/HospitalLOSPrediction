# Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains parts 1 and 2 of the Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) Prediction project. The goal is to use machine learning to predict the length of stay for patients in a hospital setting. The project leverages historical patient data to train predictive models, aiming to assist in resource allocation and operational planning.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Description
The project is divided into two main parts, each encapsulated in its respective Jupyter notebook:

- Part 1 involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
- Part 2 focuses on model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Hospital_LOS_Prediction_Part_1.ipynb
- **Input**: Dataset containing various patient metrics and previous LOS records.
- **Process**: 
  - Cleaning and normalizing the data.
  - Performing statistical analysis to understand the data's characteristics.
  - Feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning models.

### Hospital_LOS_Prediction_Part_2.ipynb
- **Input**: Preprocessed data from Part 1.
- **Process**: 
  - Building and training different machine learning models.
  - Evaluating model performance with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.

## How It Works

### Data Preparation and Exploration (Part 1)
- Detailed cleaning and preprocessing of the hospital dataset.
- Visual and statistical analysis to extract insights and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.

### Model Building and Evaluation (Part 2)
- Implementation of various regression models using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow/Keras.
- Comparison of model performance to select the best predictor.
- Tuning of model parameters for optimal predictions.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
